        <h1>Exploring the problem</h1>

        <p>
          When I joined the design team they did not have a reliable method for
          making easy-to-digest deliverables that are customizable and time
          efficient.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before diving into the design process, my initial step was to
          cultivate a profound understanding of the problem by leveraging the
          Design Thinking Methodology and the Double Diamond approach.

      <div id="user-research">
        <h1>Discover</h1>

        <p>
          Conducting interviews with the team's designers to systematically
          explore questions and challenge assumptions, thereby expanding my
          comprehension of the problem.
        </p>

        <h3>My main objective was to </h3>

        <p>
          After gathering information through interviewing I put together an
          affinity map for a better organization and look on the process so far

        <p>
          To gain an even better understading of the user experience, and for
          who are we designing for, my team and I developed a persona and
          emhpasized their goals/motivations and pain points.

        <p>
          Maintained ongoing communication with the UX Lead, who successfully
          applied our approach in testing a new client project. The results were
          positively received and utilized to present the program to additional
          senior stakeholders within the client company.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Implemented the journey mapping method on a larger internal project,
          focusing on enhancing ways of working within the organization. The
          methodology proved effective in providing valuable insights and was
          applied to streamline and improve internal processes.
